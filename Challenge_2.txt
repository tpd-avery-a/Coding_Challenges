This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, 
return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

Iterate through array
    Iterate through array
        multiply all from array except i
        count =
    push count to new array
    
return new array

declare newArray
loop through range of array using i
decleare count 1 to reset
loop through range of array using j 
if j !=i i, multiply count by array[j]
add count to newArray
